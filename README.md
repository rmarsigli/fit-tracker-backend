**A fitness tracking API built for Brazilian athletes.** Track runs, rides, and workouts with GPS precision, compete on segments, and connect with your fitness community.

---

## What is Runner App?

FitTrack BR is a comprehensive fitness tracking platform designed for the Brazilian market. Think Strava, but built from the ground up with modern Laravel architecture and powerful spatial features.

**What you can do**:
- 🏃 Track activities with real-time GPS, heart rate, and elevation
- 🗺️ Create and compete on route segments (like Strava's KOMs)
- 📊 Analyze performance with splits, pace zones, and detailed statistics
- 👥 Follow friends, give kudos, and comment on activities
- 🏆 Join distance and elevation challenges
- 🌍 Discover nearby activities and popular routes

---

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd runner/backend
composer install

# 2. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# 3. Configure database (PostgreSQL with PostGIS required)
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# 4. Enable PostGIS extension
psql your_database -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;"

# 5. Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# 6. Start server
php artisan serve

# 🎉 API is now running at http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

## API Documentation

**36 REST endpoints** organized under `/api/v1/`:

- **Activities**: `/activities/*` (CRUD, list, search)
- **Tracking**: `/tracking/*` (start, track, pause, resume, finish)
- **Statistics**: `/statistics/*` (user stats, splits, pace zones)
- **Segments**: `/segments/*` (CRUD, nearby search, leaderboards)
- **Social**: Follow, kudos, comments, feed
- **Challenges**: Create, join, progress tracking

**Full API documentation**: [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)

**Postman Collection**: Import `docs/postman-collection.json` for quick testing with pre-configured requests.

---

## Database Schema

**Main tables**:
- `users` - User accounts with spatial location
- `activities` - GPS-tracked activities with routes (PostGIS LineString)
- `segments` - Route segments for competition
- `segment_efforts` - Individual attempts on segments
- `follows` - User follow relationships
- `kudos` - Activity likes
- `comments` - Activity comments
- `challenges` - Distance/duration challenges

**PostGIS spatial columns**: Activities and segments store GPS routes as LineStrings with seven GIST indexes for optimal spatial query performance.

## Architecture Highlights

**Modern Laravel Architecture**:
- Data classes for DTOs (replaces Form Requests + API Resources)
- ValueObjects for domain concepts (Distance, Duration, Pace, Speed)
- Strong typing throughout (PHP 8.4 features plus PHPStan Level 5)
- Smart file organization (domain-driven structure)

**PostGIS Integration**:
- Custom SQL helpers for spatial queries
- No third-party packages needed
- Seven GIST indexes for performance
- Efficient segment detection using spatial intersections

**Real-time Tracking**:
- Redis-based temporary storage (2h TTL)
- Background processing with queues
- Automatic segment detection on activity completion

**For more details**: See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

curl https://api.fittrackbr.com/api/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# Detailed health check
curl https://api.fittrackbr.com/api/health/detailed
# Returns: App version, PHP version, Laravel version

# Readiness check (database + redis + sentry)
curl https://api.fittrackbr.com/api/health/ready
# Expected: {"status":"ready","checks":{"database":true,"redis":true,"sentry":true}}
```
