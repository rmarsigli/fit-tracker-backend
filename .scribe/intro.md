    Welcome to the FitTrack BR API documentation. This API allows you to build fitness tracking applications with features like:

    - **Activity Tracking**: Real-time GPS tracking with pause/resume capabilities
    - **Segments**: Create and compete on route segments with leaderboards
    - **Statistics**: Detailed metrics including pace zones, splits, and historical data
    - **Social Features**: Public activity feeds and following system

    All API endpoints return JSON responses and use Laravel Sanctum for authentication.

    <aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
    You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
